Process_Stage,Material_Type,Energy_kWh_per_ton,CO2_kg_per_ton,Notes
Precursor Production,Silica,3000,800,Sodium silicate (waterglass) route ~5.4 GJ/ton (≈1500 kWh/ton solution) or ~11 GJ/ton per silica solid 
Sol-Gel Synthesis (Mixing/Aging),Silica,50,10,Low-energy step at <100 °C; only on the order of tens of kWh per ton 
Drying,Silica,5500,1200,Typically the largest energy demand: evaporating water requires ~15–24 MJ/kg 
Calcination,Silica,3500,700,"High-temperature calcination (450–600 °C) to burn out organics, if used "
Precursor Production,Zeolite,2500,1200,Upstream raw materials synthesis is energy-intensive. e.g. producing Na₂SiO₃ ~5.4 GJ/ton 
Hydrothermal Synthesis,Zeolite,300,60,Crystallization of gel in autoclave (90–200 °C for hours/days) requires substantial heat input 
Drying,Zeolite,5000,1000,Major energy stage: removing water from filtrated crystals costs ~15–24 MJ/kg 
Calcination,Zeolite,2000,500,High-temp calcination (500–650 °C for 0.5–6 h) burns off organic templates and activates the zeolite 
Raw Material Prep & Chemicals,Glass (Soda-Lime),600,200,"Mining, crushing, and batch preparation is a small energy share (~4% of plant total) "
Melting & Refining (Furnace),Glass (Soda-Lime),1200,600,Melting at ~1500 °C dominates energy (~70–80% of total) 
Forming & Annealing,Glass (Soda-Lime),120,50,Product forming (shaping) and annealing (controlled cooling) consume the remaining ~15–25% of energy
