## 🧠 Overview
This project analyzes and compares the **energy requirements** and **carbon emissions** associated with the industrial-scale production of **porous silica beads** and **zeolites**, two key materials used in catalysis, chromatography, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Using quantitative data from life-cycle assessments, industrial studies, and sustainability reports, it aims to:

- Break down energy use by **production stage** (e.g., drying, calcination, crystallization)
- Estimate associated **CO₂ emissions per ton of material**
- Compare traditional and advanced manufacturing routes
- Explore the **environmental impact** of switching to greener energy inputs or more efficient processes

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- 📊 Visualize and compare energy and emission intensity of silica vs. zeolite production
- 🔍 Identify energy “hotspots” (e.g., drying and calcination)
- ♻️ Model potential emission savings through renewable energy adoption or process optimization
- 🏗️ Showcase applied quantitative analysis in support of sustainable engineering strategies

## 📌 Why This Matters
Porous materials are essential to clean energy, pharmaceuticals, and industrial separations—but their production is **surprisingly carbon-intensive**. This project demonstrates how **data science** and **engineering analysis** can be used to assess and ultimately improve the sustainability of critical materials.
